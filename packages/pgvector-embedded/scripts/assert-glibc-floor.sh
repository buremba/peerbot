# Assert that a prebuilt Linux pgvector library does not require a newer glibc
# than we promise to support.
#
# Why this exists: a shared library links against the glibc it was compiled on
# and refuses to load on anything older, so the BUILD HOST's glibc silently
# becomes the product's support floor. `build-pgvector-embedded.yml` used
# `ubuntu-latest`; when that label moved to 24.04 (glibc 2.39) the published
# `vector.so` picked up `__isoc23_strtol@GLIBC_2.38` — the gcc-13 uplift of
# plain `strtol` — and `lobu run` stopped being able to boot embedded Postgres
# on Debian 12 (including `node:22-slim`), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, RHEL 9 and AL2023:
#
#   could not load library ".../vector.so": /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:
#   version `GLIBC_2.38' not found
#
# Nothing else catches it. CI only ever loads this library on a modern-glibc
# runner, so the artifact looks fine right up until a user on an older distro
# runs the quickstart from the landing page.
