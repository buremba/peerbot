/**
 * Server-side enforcement of the promotions pause.
 *
 * A `lobu rollback` pauses promotions for the org so a later `lobu apply`
 * cannot silently re-push the config that was just rolled back. The pause row
 * has lived server-side since #2068, but only the CLI ever honoured it
 * (`apply-cmd.ts` asked, then refused locally), so anything posting straight at
 * the API — CI holding a PAT, or a client predating the check — walked through
 * the exact gate the feature was built to close. Gating the deployment SUMMARY
 * route would not have helped: that record is written after `executePlan` has
 * already mutated the org, and the CLI swallows its failure, so rejecting it
 * blocks nothing and only destroys the audit trail of the offending apply.
 *
 * The seam is the apply header. `x-lobu-apply-id` marks a request as part of a
 * `lobu apply` run, so gating on it freezes promotions without freezing the
 * product: interactive edits from Owletto and one-off API calls carry no such
 * header and are unaffected. This is deliberately a workflow guard, not an
 * authorization credential: it stops cooperating `lobu apply` clients from
 * accidentally re-promoting, but an otherwise-authorized caller can omit the
 * header and remains free to make an ordinary one-off edit.
 *
 * Read-tier calls stay allowed. `lobu apply` reads current config to compute
 * its diff, and `--dry-run` is how an operator inspects what a resume would do;
 * blocking reads would make a paused org undiagnosable.
 *
 * Rollbacks stay allowed. Rolling back FURTHER, because the first rollback did
 * not fix it, is the main thing an operator does while paused. `rollback-cmd`
 * sets the pause before its first mutation to close the re-promotion window, so
 * a blanket block would strand the rollback behind the pause it just created.
 * A rollback declares itself with `x-lobu-rollback-of`, which is checked
 * against a real, restorable deployment in the already-authorized org. The
 * header classifies a CLI workflow; it is not an authentication credential and
 * never chooses the user or organization.

 *    through that proxy as POSTs (`manage_entity_schema` list, `manage_feeds`
 *    get, …), so the method-based rule below would classify them as mutations
 *    and break `--dry-run` against a paused org — the exact carve-out the
 *    feature promises. The proxy decides read-vs-write from the tool args, which
 *    is the only signal that is actually correct there.
 *  - `POST /deployments` records the outcome after the apply has stopped. It is
 *    audit-only (the route independently validates admin authority and the
 *    summary body), so blocking it would erase the evidence of a refused run.
 *  - `DELETE /deployments/pause` is how `lobu apply --resume` clears the pause.
 *    Gating it would make the pause unexitable.
 *
 * For everything else the HTTP method is the signal: every direct read the CLI
 * issues is a GET, every direct mutation is POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE.
