/**
 * A connector key may not collide with a static `/connectors/` route segment.
 *
 * `/connectors/<key>/<connectionId>` is a catch-all param, and TanStack Router
 * matches a static sibling first — so a connector installed as `device` would
 * have every connection page it owns swallowed by the device detail route. The
 * install is rejected at metadata validation, the gate the source-backed
 * install paths (source_url, source_uri, source_code, bundled catalog) go
 * through. mcp_url installs skip it, but their keys are always `mcp.`-prefixed
 * and can never equal a bare route segment.
