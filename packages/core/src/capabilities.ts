// blindly: a compromised or buggy device could claim arbitrary capabilities
// and start matching unrelated connectors. This registry maps each known
// platform to the capabilities it is allowed to advertise. Anything outside
// the allowlist is silently dropped (the device's effective capability set
// shrinks; nothing throws).
//
// The trusted-fleet path (no `platform` on the row — those workers run with
// WORKER_API_TOKEN and the `c.var.workerAuthMode !== 'user'` branch) bypasses
// authorization entirely; we trust them by definition.

// Capability strings — keep namespaced (`browser.*`, `os.*`, `ios.*`) so the
// registry stays readable as new device kinds land.
