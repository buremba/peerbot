/**
 * Integration test for the stale device-worker reaper's automation binding.
 *
 * An ARCHIVED Automation can never execute again, so it must not count as a
 * binding that keeps a dead machine alive — otherwise one soft-deleted row
 * anchors its device permanently and the reaper skips it every night. Because
 * `automations.device_worker_id` is a NO ACTION FK, ignoring archived rows in
 * the predicate is not enough on its own: the pin has to be released inside the
 * delete transaction or the FK rejects the DELETE.
 *
 * A LIVE pin must still block, and must not be cleared as a side effect — that
 * is the difference between reaping a dead machine and silently un-pinning a
 * runnable Automation.
 *
 * The suite also covers the reaper's other two exits, which the pin work left
 * untested: child-token revocation (scoped to the worker_ids actually deleted)
 * and the `auth_profiles` predicate, whose FK is ON DELETE CASCADE and so fails
 * silently rather than loudly if the guard is ever lost.
