/**
 * `device_workers` is the one allowlisted relation that is NOT org-scoped.
 *
 * Its PK is `(user_id, worker_id)` and `organization_id` is nullable — the org
 * records where a device is ATTACHED, not who owns it. Scoping the CTE on the
 * org alone would let any member of a shared workspace enumerate every
 * colleague's machines: `label` is normally a personal name and `last_seen_at`
 * is a presence feed. `query_sql` is member-safe, so the owner predicate is
 * what makes this entry safe to expose at all.
 *
 * The integration sibling (device-workers-query-scope.test.ts) proves the rows
 * really are filtered; this pins the emitted SQL so the predicate can't be
 * loosened without a test noticing.
