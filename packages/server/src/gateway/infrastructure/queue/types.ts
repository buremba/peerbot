 * (which holds the client's SSE) must win a SKIP-LOCKED claim before delivery.
 *

 * span hours) plus a raised retry limit gives a ~30s re-claim window. That
 * covers both the cross-pod hand-off and the client's POST→connect gap at the
 * small replica counts we run. On the LAST claim the consumer stops re-queueing
 * and renders locally instead (see the owner-gate in unified-thread-consumer):
 * the client may well be gone, but the terminal row's durable side effects —
 * Automation run resolution above all — must still run, and dead-lettering the
 * row skipped them.

 * without this flag, a legitimately hour-long prior turn would exhaust the
