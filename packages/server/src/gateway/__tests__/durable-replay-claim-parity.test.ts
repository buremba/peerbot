/**
 * A per-run token is minted once, but its claim set is rebuilt BY HAND on three
 * further paths: `durableClaims` (persisting to `agent_run_input.token_claims`),
 * `attachFreshRunJobToken` (the durable-replay remint), and the
 * `/worker/token/refresh` route. Every claim on `WorkerTokenData` is optional,
 * so a mapper that forgets one still typechecks — the claim is simply gone the
 * moment a run replays or a long turn rotates its token.
 *
 * This has now happened twice. `nixPackages` was the first: losing it on replay
 * left an authenticated `gh` that was never installed. The capture pair was the
 * second, and worse — a dropped `executionMode` reads as live, so an eval
 * replay stops recording and starts performing real side effects against the
 * org it is scoring.
 *
 * Hence the whole-fixture projection below rather than another hand-picked list
 * of expectations.
