/**
 * Long-horizon expiry for undecided approvals.
 *
 * A run queued behind a human gate lands at `approval_status='pending'` and is
 * DELIBERATELY exempt from the short-horizon claim reaper (#2044, see
 * scheduled/stale-run-sweeper.ts): no worker will ever claim it, so timing it
 * out on the 120s claim horizon would kill the run before anyone could decide.
 * That exemption was never paired with a long-horizon expiry, so undecided
 * approvals accumulated forever — cluttering the approvals surface and keeping
 * side effects queued against inputs that went stale months ago.
 *
 * This reaper closes that hole at the OTHER end of the timescale: rows still
 * pending after `intervals.pendingApprovalTtlDays` (default 7 DAYS) go terminal
 * at `approval_status='expired', status='cancelled'`. It never touches anything
 * inside the TTL, so the #2044 grace window is untouched — the two reapers do
 * not overlap in the horizons they cover.
 *
 * 'expired' is a distinct value, not a reuse of 'rejected': rejection is a HUMAN
 * decision the batch-reject path feeds back to the Automation as a `correction` to
 * learn from, while expiry is the system giving up on an undecided run. An agent
 * must not train on silence as if it were disapproval.
 *
 * Scope is both human-gated lanes — `action` (connector operations) and
 * `internal` (builder / entity-change / Automation proposals). Nothing else can
 * hold `approval_status='pending'`.
 *
 * Fairness + throughput: candidates are selected round-robin across
 * organizations — interleaved by per-org rank, with a per-org cap — so neither
 * one huge tenant nor the N oldest tenants can consume a batch and starve
 * everyone else. The sweep then drains successive batches within a bounded
 * per-invocation ceiling, so a backlog larger than one batch clears in a single
 * run instead of one batch per daily tick.
 *
 * Multi-pod safety: the UPDATE re-asserts `approval_status = 'pending'`, so it
 * is the authoritative claim — a row a human approved between scan and write is
 * excluded by the predicate, and only one overlapping runner can commit an
 * expiry for a row. Pure Postgres, correct under N>1 replicas. The run
 * transition and card supersession share a transaction: if the event write
 * fails, the run remains pending for the next sweep.
