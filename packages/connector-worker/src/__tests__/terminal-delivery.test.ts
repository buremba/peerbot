/**
 * `completeActionOnce` carries an already-decided terminal outcome to the
 * gateway. Losing it costs a real run: the gateway then has no report and the
 * stale-run reaper mislabels a finished action as a timeout. These pin the two
 * properties that make the retry worth having — a hung first attempt is
 * retried inside the remaining budget, and a payload the gateway could not
 * parse is not re-sent.
