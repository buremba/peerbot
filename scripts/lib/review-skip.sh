# review-skip.sh — safe-class diff classifier for the cross-harness review.
# shellcheck shell=bash
#
# REVIEWER_MODE=light (default) skips the cross-harness reviewer when the diff
# is small AND every changed file is in a class where an independent LLM review
# adds near-zero signal: docs, CI-verified generated output, the root Bun
# lockfile, snapshots, exact renames between safe-class paths, additive-only
# test changes, exact model-literal swaps in lobu.config.ts, or a pure
# packages/owletto pointer bump. Everything else — non-test source, migrations,
# runtime-affecting config, static assets, other/mixed submodule changes, and the
# gate/CI machinery itself — forces the full review regardless of size.
#
# The classifier is deterministic and path-gated. The driving agent may only
# escalate (REVIEWER_MODE=full), never skip on self-assessed confidence: the
# whole point of the cross-harness review is independence from the authoring
# model's blind spots, and confidence is anti-correlated with exactly those.

# Output contract read by review.sh and the tests.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
REVIEW_SKIP_REASON=""

# Any diff that touches these paths must run the full review, no matter how
# small. Package manifests and runtime-affecting config control the same subsystems
# (auth, queues, deps) that a src change would escalate on; and the gate
# machinery itself must never be reviewed by its own skip rule.
#
# The packages/owletto pointer is handled below: Owletto owns semantic review
# of its content, and `check-drift` forbids pinning anything not on its main
# branch. Only a pointer-to-pointer change with no companion path is safe;
# additions, removals, type changes, and every other submodule still escalate.
