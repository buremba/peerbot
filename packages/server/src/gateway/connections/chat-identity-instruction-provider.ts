/**
 * Shared identity and participant framing for chat platforms.
 *
 * An agent reached over chat needs two facts nothing else in the prompt
 * supplies: WHO it is in the conversation, and that the messages it receives
 * are addressed TO it. Without them it has only its identity/soul markdown,
 * which describes the principal in the third person ("you work on the user's
 * data on their behalf") and never says the person currently typing IS that
 * principal. The model resolves that ambiguity per turn, often the wrong way:
 * it treats the message as observed conversation about a third party and
 * narrates it back — "Burak is asking … how would you like to respond?" — to an
 * operator who does not exist. Slack never showed this only because its
 * provider happened to say "You are reachable in Slack as `@x`", which implies
 * participation; every platform declaring no provider got nothing.
 *
 * Identity is best-effort, the framing is not. `Adapter.botUserId` is optional
 * in the Chat SDK, a turn may carry no `connectionId`, and the store can fail —
 * in all three cases the handle is omitted but the framing still renders, since
 * the framing is the half that resolves the ambiguity.
 *
 * PROMPT-CACHE CONTRACT — read before adding a line here.
 * This block sits at the FRONT of `gatewayInstructions` (`session-context.ts`),
 * and the openai-completions path has no explicit cache breakpoints: reuse is
 * longest-common-prefix only. Everything emitted here must be CONNECTION-scoped
 * (platform, bot handle, bot id) — constant for the life of the connection, so
 * every conversation on it shares one prefix. Never interpolate anything
 * CONVERSATION-scoped (sender name, channel/chat id, message text, timestamps):
 * that hands every new conversation a unique prefix and forfeits the cache for
 * all of them. Those belong in the per-turn run context, which is not cached.
 * A test pins this by rendering two users/sessions on one connection and
 * asserting byte equality.
