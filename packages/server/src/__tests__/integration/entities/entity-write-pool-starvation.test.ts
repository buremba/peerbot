/**
 * Entity-write transactions must never ask the POOL for a second connection.
 *
 * `withEntityWriteTransaction` holds ONE pooled connection for the whole write.
 * A helper inside it that reaches for `getDb()` instead of the caller's handle
 * needs a SECOND connection while still holding the first, so `DB_POOL_MAX`
 * concurrent writers each hold a slot and each wait for a slot only another
 * writer can free. Session waits are unbounded, so the pool is dead for the life
 * of the process — the #2818 hang, whose signature is exactly `DB_POOL_MAX`
 * sessions `idle in transaction` on the same statement.
 *
 * Same one-directional-dependency rule `getLockDb()` already documents for
 * session advisory locks, applied to the entity write path.
 *
 * These assert the INVARIANT (every statement of a write goes through the
 * caller's handle) rather than staging the deadlock itself. Staging it means
 * shrinking the shared singleton pool, and that singleton is process-wide across
 * every file in a Vitest worker — an earlier draft did exactly that and left a
 * later file in the same shard with a closed pool. The invariant is also the
 * stronger check: it fails on a reintroduced `getDb()` directly, without
 * depending on how many writers happen to be concurrent.
 *
 * The fourth fixed site, `ensureResourceEntityType`, needs no case here: its
 * handle parameter is required, so a regression is a compile error.
