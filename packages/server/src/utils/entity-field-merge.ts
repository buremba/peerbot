/**
 * Shared entity field-merge primitive for the watcher<->human feedback loop.
 *
 * The value lives in `entities.metadata`; per-field ownership lives in the sparse
 * `entities.field_controls` jsonb column (a key present = that field is human-owned).
 * This is the SINGLE write path for both human edits and watcher promotion:
 *   - source='human'  : writes every changed field AND marks it owned (note/set_by/set_at).
 *   - source='watcher': writes only fields that are NOT human-owned; owned fields are
 *     returned in `blocked` (the caller emits an approval) and never overwritten.
 *
 * This module is the pure decision engine — unit-testable without a DB. The
 * transaction-bound persistence wrapper is `mergeEntityFields`, which lives in
 * entity-management.ts so the write goes through the physical row kernel.
 * Callers own the audit `'change'` event (handleUpdate / promotion emit it).
