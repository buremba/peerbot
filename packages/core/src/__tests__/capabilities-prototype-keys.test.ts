/**
 * Platform names arrive from a worker's poll body, so `PLATFORM_ALLOWLIST`
 * lookups must never resolve up the prototype chain.
 *
 * `"toString" in PLATFORM_ALLOWLIST` is `true`, so a bare `in` check made
 * `isKnownPlatform("toString")` pass. The connector-worker CLI validates
 * `--platform` with exactly that call, so the daemon would start and register,
 * and the server would then throw inside `authorizeCapabilities` — where the
 * inherited value is a function and `new Set(fn)` is not iterable.
