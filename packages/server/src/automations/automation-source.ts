/**
 * Who to attribute a durable write to, resolved once for every write surface.
 *
 * An acting Automation reaches a handler on two channels: `ctx.actingAutomationId`,
 * stamped by the reaction executor and therefore trustworthy, and a caller-declared
 * `automation_source` argument, which is ordinary user input. Every surface used to
 * merge them inline with `ctx.actingAutomationId ?? args.automation_source?.automation_id`,
 * which trusts the declared half without ever checking it names an Automation in
 * this organization. That has three consequences, all silent:
 *
 *   - a foreign id misattributes the write to another Automation, and where the
 *     value reaches `events.automation_id` it also inherits that Automation's
 *     causal chain (`workspace-event-enqueue.ts`)
 *   - a NONEXISTENT id fails the `events_automation_id_fkey` constraint, and
 *     because audit writes are fire-and-forget the row is dropped entirely
 *   - a declared run belonging to a DIFFERENT Automation batches this
 *     proposal into that Automation's approval card
 *
 * `notify.ts` has validated this field for exactly these reasons since it was
 * added; `execute.ts` started doing so in #2952. This module is that same rule
 * in one place, so a new write surface inherits it instead of re-deriving it.
 *
 * Kept free of tool and gateway imports so any write surface can reach it.
