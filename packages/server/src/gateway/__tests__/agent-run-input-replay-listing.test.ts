/**
 * `listPendingAgentRunInputs` against real rows: which turns does a
 * reconnecting worker's `registerWorker` replay re-enqueue?
 *
 * The replay exists to restore turns whose queue row was expired-and-deleted
 * while the worker was offline. Any surviving row — the original job pending a
 * dispatch-gate deferral retry, the gate's own claimed job held across a
 * recycle, or a completed delivery receipt for a turn the reconnecting worker
 * is still running — means the queue owns the turn, and replaying over it
 * delivers the same turn TWICE. The recycle path makes this concrete: it
 * rebuilds the worker while holding its claimed job, so without the queue-row
 * predicate every recycle double-delivers the very turn that triggered it.
