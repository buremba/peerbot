/**
 * $member projection-drift alerter.
 *
 * The authz channel-visibility gate resolves a signed-in user to their `$member`
 * entity via an `entity_identities` row: namespace `auth_user_id`, source
 * `auth:signup`, on an entity of type `$member`. When a better-auth `member` row
 * exists WITHOUT that claim, the gate resolves the user to nothing and hides
 * every enforced channel from them. Provisioning hooks log and swallow identity
 * write failures, so the missing projection can persist after membership is
 * committed.
 *
 * This job is the smoke detector, NOT the repair. It scans for two failure
 * shapes; the scheduler logs a non-zero result so provisioning regressions
 * surface without waiting for a user to report hidden channels:
 *
 *   1. `missing_claim` — a `member` row with no matching `$member` + `auth:signup`
 *      claim in that org. The historical drift.
 *
 *   2. `poison_claim` — a live `auth_user_id` claim that blocks the correct
 *      insert but points to the wrong entity shape or source.
 *
 * Read-only. Single-claimant per tick via the runs-queue (registered in
 * scheduled/jobs.ts), so multi-replica safe with no extra coordination.
