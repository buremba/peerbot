/**
 * A device that stopped polling must be reported offline within the liveness
 * window, and the report must say how stale it is.
 *
 * Measured on prod 2026-08-05: a chrome extension whose poll loop died was
 * reported `readiness: "ready", executable: true` for the full 18 minutes it
 * was dead, because `device_online` was `last_seen_at > now() - 20 minutes`.
 * Every dispatch in that window sat for the 60s queue budget and then failed
 * with "the device may be offline" — a guess the server had the data to
 * answer. The window is now 120s and the staleness is stated, not implied.
 *
 * The fixtures below sit at 5 minutes stale: OFFLINE under the current window,
 * ONLINE under the old one. That gap is the regression this file pins.
