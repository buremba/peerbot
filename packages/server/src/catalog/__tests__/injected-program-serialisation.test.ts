/**
 * A connector that drives a page injects a program by serialising a function
 * with `Function.prototype.toString()` and evaluating `(<source>)()` there.
 * That works only while every binding the function needs lives INSIDE it.
 *
 * The connector's own suite already proves the SOURCE function is
 * self-contained. This proves the shipped artifact is, which is a different
 * claim: the gateway ships the COMPILED bundle, and bundling is free to hoist
 * a shared helper to module scope and reference it from inside the function.
 * esbuild does exactly that when it downlevels object spread or optional
 * chaining (`__spreadValues`, `__objRest`). The serialised text would then
 * name an identifier the page cannot resolve, and the run would die with a
 * ReferenceError at injection — with nothing failing at build or type-check
 * time, and no test between the two catching it.
