/**
 * Member execution authorization for connector operations (`operations.execute`).
 *
 * Regression contract for the prod-readiness finding: an MCP session was told
 * an operation was "ready/executable" (list_available) and then DENIED at
 * execute with "requires an MCP session with admin access." Three properties
 * must hold:
 *
 *  1. `execute` is member-write, not owner-admin — a member (or an owner whose
 *     token carries `mcp:read mcp:write` but not `mcp:admin`) can invoke it.
 *     Readiness advertising "ready" must not be a lie.
 *  2. The handler STILL enforces per-principal connection visibility — a member
 *     cannot execute on a connection they cannot see. This is the security
 *     property that makes "member can execute" safe.
 *  3. `list_available` is principal-aware: a read-only session sees every op
 *     as not-executable with a session-scope elevation next_action instead of
 *     "ready → execute → denied".
