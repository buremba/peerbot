/**
 * Repro probe: the listed identity of an MCP client must be what it REGISTERED
 * as, not what happens to be driving the current session.
 *
 * `oauth_clients.client_name` is set once at dynamic registration.
 * `metadata.last_client_info.name` is overwritten on every MCP `initialize`,
 * and it reflects the PROCESS holding the connection — so an Owletto Mac build
 * driven by the Claude Code SDK reports `claude-code`.
 *
 * Letting clientInfo win made two things wrong at once, both measured on prod
 * 2026-07-30 (19 rows, all 19 mismatched):
 *   - the displayed vendor was the driver, not the app: "Owletto for Mac" and
 *     "Lobu CLI" both rendered as "claude-code", ChatGPT as "openai-mcp"
 *   - `firstParty` keyed off that polluted name, so Lobu's own surfaces lost
 *     their badge whenever a third-party runtime drove them — that field is
 *     now deleted rather than repaired (see the third test)
 *
 * Both fixtures below are copied from real prod rows.
