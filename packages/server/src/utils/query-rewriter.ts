/**
 * Server-side query rewriter for retrieval recall.
 *
 * Conversational / underspecified questions retrieve poorly:
 *   - Filler ("I think we discussed X earlier, can you remind me…") embeds and
 *     keyword-matches noisily, so the gold session ranks below the cutoff.
 *   - Synonym gaps ("how many doctors") miss sessions that say
 *     "physician" / "ENT" / "dermatologist".
 *
 * This helper asks a small LLM to rewrite the question into a few focused
 * keyword search queries (filler stripped, synonym variants added). The caller
 * (read_knowledge / get_content) invokes it ONLY as an on-miss rescue: when the
 * primary single-query search returns nothing, it searches each variant with an
 * over-fetched internal limit and FUSES the candidates by best relevance score
 * per event, recovering a session the raw phrasing could not reach. There is no
 * caller-facing flag — the rescue self-heals on a total miss, so a query that
 * already found something never pays for it.
 *
 * Statelessness: this is a pure per-request retrieval helper. It holds no
 * shared/in-memory state, so it is trivially correct under N>1 app replicas —
 * each request rewrites independently, nothing to fan out across pods.
 *
 * Credentials come from an org-owned OpenAI-compatible provider row via the
 * shared gateway completion client. An unsupported or missing provider (or any
 * failure) yields [] and the caller falls back to the raw query alone.
